    <h2>ERIK BOESEN</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Erik. I'm a sophomore in high school. I'm director of UI for <a href="http://1418.team">FRC Team 1418</a> and am preparing to lead our whole programming team. I write a <a href="blog">blog</a> and I've programmed lots of stuff which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/ErikBoesen">my GitHub</a>. I'm into Python, Golang, and [insert this week's language obsession here], and have a lot of experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Node. I'm a <a href="http://mnmlist.com/what-is-mnmlist-com">minimalist</a> and like to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930">read</a>.
