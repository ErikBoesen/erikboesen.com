    <h2>ERIK BOESEN</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Erik. I'm a junior in high school and the programming captain of <a href="http://1418.team">FRC Team 1418</a>. I write a <a href="blog">blog</a> and I've worked on lots of different code which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/ErikBoesen">my GitHub</a>. I'm into GNU/Linux, Python, C(++), Go, and [insert this week's language obsession here], and have a lot of experience with web development. I'm a <a href="http://mnmlist.com/what-is-mnmlist-com">minimalist</a> and love <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930">books</a>. Check out my social profiles below, although be warned that my Instagram account is run by a bot.</p>
