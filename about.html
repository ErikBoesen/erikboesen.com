            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class="parallaxWindow"></div>
            <p>I'm a 15-year old geek living in Falls Church, Virginia. I love photography, hiking, writing, cycling, music, and tech. I go to George Mason High School, where I'm currently in ninth grade. I'm a Zen Buddhist.</p>
            <p>In my free time I do <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/108614122@N04">photography</a>, design websites, or play guitar. I also enjoy biking, backpacking, climbing (rock or otherwise), and writing. I love listening to nearly all genres of music, including rock, alternative, electronic, pop, etc. If you like, you can listen to a playlist of all my favorite music <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/erikboesen/starred">here</a>. I'm part of the Technology Student Association and FIRST Robotics.</p>

            <h3>What I've done</h3>
            <p>Throughout my life I've been interested in technology, and have gained experience in many areas of it, including CAD, sound, video, TV broadcast directing, game design, app development, robotics, back-end, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/108614122@N04">photography</a> &amp; graphic design, writing/<a href="blog">blogging</a> &amp; <a href="electronics-store">electronics and hardware</a>, <a href="web">web</a>, and more.</p>
            <p>I've volunteered twice at <a href="http://newdaycreations.com/foster">New Day</a>, a Chinese foster home for orphans with special needs. I've also been to Malaysia and lived in Chicago for four years. In 8th grade I achieved the Gold award in <a href="http://tsaweb.org">Technology Student Association</a>, and also directed my school's Morning Announcements. I competed in the <a href="http://firstlegoleague.org">FIRST Lego Robotics</a> challenge four times during Middle School. I played Trumpet for four years before switching to Guitar.</p>

            <h3>What I'm going to do</h3>
            <p>After finishing high school at <a href="http://fccps.org/gm">George Mason</a> I'm going to apply to Stanford, MIT, or the University of Michigan. Then I want to work at Google, or a web agency such as <a href="http://viget.com">Viget</a> or <a href="http://interactivestrategies.com">Interactive Strategies</a>. Later in life I plan to be a tech teacher and bring new teaching methods to elementary/Middle School Computer Science education. That is, assuming human teachers are not yet obsolete.</p>
