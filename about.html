        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <section class="one right">
            <div class="parallaxWindow"></div>
            <h3>Who I am</h3>
            <p>I'm a 14-year old geek living in Falls Church, Virginia. I love photography, hiking, writing, cycling, listening to music, making <a href="http://redbubble.com/people/robotplunger/works/8181718?p=sticker">obscure geeky references</a>, and anything with technology. In Chinese I'm called 包天佑. It means Blessed/Protected by Heaven, although Google Translate may <a href="https://translate.google.com/#zh-CN/en/%E5%8C%85%E5%A4%A9%E4%BD%91">tell you otherwise</a>.</p>
            <p>Other than my interest in technology, I'm a somewhat normal teenager (except without the rebellion and tattoos). I go to Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School. You can read about my religious thoughts <a href="blog/religion">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>What I've done</h3>
            <p>Throughout my life I've been interested in technology, and have gained experience in many areas of it, including CAD, sound, video, TV broadcast directing, game design, app development, robotics, back-end, <a href="photography">photography</a> &amp; graphic design, writing/<a href="blog">blogging</a> &amp; <a href="electronics-store">electronics and hardware</a>, <a href="web">web</a>, and more.
            <p>I've volunteered twice at <a href="http://newdaycreations.com/foster">New Day</a>, a Chinese foster home for orphans with special needs. I've also been to Malaysia and lived in Chicago for four years. In 8th grade I achieved the Gold award in <a href="http://tsaweb.org">Technology Student Association</a>, and also directed my school's Morning Announcements. I competed in the <a href="http://firstlegoleague.org">FIRST Lego Robotics</a> challenge four times during Middle School.</p>

            <div class="parallaxWindow" title="Volunteering at Jill's House (jillshouse.org). I since got my braces off."></div>
            <h3>What I do</h3>
            <p>I'm mainly interested in <a href="web">photography</a>, <a href="web">web design</a>, and tech/hardware <a href="tech-support">repair &amp; support</a>.</p>
            <p>In my free time I do <a href="photography">photography</a> or write about social issues, tech, and my brain's random musings on my <a href="blog">blog</a>. I also enjoy biking, backpacking, and climbing (rock or otherwise), and playing the trumpet. I do occasional drawing. I love listening to nearly all genres of music, including rock, alternative, electronic, and occasionally pop. If you like, you can listen to a playlist of all my favorite music <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/erikboesen/starred">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>What I'm going to do</h3>
            <p>Next year, I'll start High School at <a href="http://fccps.org/gm">George Mason</a>, where I'll become proficient in numerous subjects whilst focusing in on Computer Science-related subjects. I'll also participate in the school's FIRST Robotics club, where I plan to learn a lot about robots and applying technology in the real world. After High School, I'm going to apply to Stanford, MIT, or the University of Michigan. Then I want to work at Google, or a web agency such as <a href="http://viget.com">Viget</a> or <a href="http://interactivestrategies.com">Interactive Strategies</a>. Later in life I plan to be a tech teacher and bring new teaching methods to elementary/Middle School Computer Science education. That is, assuming human teachers are not yet obsolete.</p>
