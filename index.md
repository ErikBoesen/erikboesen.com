Hi, my name is Erik. I'm a sophomore in high school and the leader of the UI team of my school's [robotics](http://firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team, [1418](http://1418.team). I'm also the founder and director of the tech consulting firm [ebt labs](ebt), which offers high-quality yet affordable software/website development and consultation services.
